Hi Chandana

Thanks for contacting Brightcove support

The paramaters you have sent us were valid to our deprecated Smart Player

The integration of Omniture within the Brightcove player it's only possible with an open source plugin https://github.com/brightcove/videojs-omniture 

Unfortunately due to the nature of the integration, it does require development experience and as it's open source, it's outside of the scope of what Brightcove Support can configure

There is also a documentation on how to implement it, which can be found here:
https://support.brightcove.com/brightcove-open-source-projects#bc-ipnav-3 
https://github.com/BrightcoveOS/videojs-omniture 
https://github.com/BrightcoveOS/videojs-omniture/blob/master/Adobe%20Analytics%20(Omniture)%20Plugin%20Documentation%20v3.pdf 

Please let me know if there is something else I can help you with.
